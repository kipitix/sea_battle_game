# sea_battle_game

Pet project for continue golang practice

## Project structure

Structure for core was got form this [example](https://github.com/sklinkert/go-ddd/tree/master).

I guess it will be good for my purpose.

Also was used [common structure](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/tree/master) for additional files.
